# Session Handoff

## Current Objective

- Goal: Build a resumable local Go CLI that labels approximately 30,000 safety samples through an OpenAI-compatible LLM API.
- Current status: `feat-001` is complete; `feat-002` is next.
- Branch / commit: `feature/sendllm-implementation`; base setup commit `7259b09`.

## Completed This Session

- [x] Resolved product scope and data contract.
- [x] Selected SQLite-backed architecture.
- [x] Designed concurrency, retry, validation, and export behavior.
- [x] Created a minimal agent harness with concrete feature dependencies.
- [x] Added Uber Go guide requirements to `AGENTS.md`.
- [x] Converted the complete design specification to Chinese.
- [x] Received user approval for the persisted Chinese design.
- [x] Wrote and self-reviewed the seven-task implementation plan.
- [x] Added mandatory minimal-code and Chinese-comment rules before implementation.
- [x] Added the real-model 50-record end-to-end completion gate.
- [x] Added Go 1.24 module, typed configuration loader, prompt/risk/schema loading, validation, semantic fingerprint, and API key environment lookup.
- [x] Added extensible source, annotation, and OpenAI-compatible completion DTO contracts.
- [x] Added example real-gateway configuration without credentials, complete MASB taxonomy, result Schema, and system prompt.

## Verification Evidence

| Check | Command | Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Harness validation | `validate-harness.mjs --target .` | pass | 100/100; all subsystems 5/5. |
| Config and DTO tests | `go test ./internal/lib/configs ./internal/dto` | pass | Covers strict loading, defaults, source normalization, and annotation contracts. |
| Go verification | `./init.sh` | pass | Formatting, unit tests, race tests, and vet all passed. |

## Files Changed

- `AGENTS.md`
- `feature_list.json`
- `progress.md`
- `session-handoff.md`
- `init.sh`
- `.gitignore`
- `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-05-sendllm-design.md`
- `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-05-sendllm-implementation.md`
- `go.mod`, `go.sum`
- `internal/lib/configs/config.go`, `internal/lib/configs/load.go`, and tests
- `internal/dto/sample.go`, `annotation.go`, `completion.go`, and tests
- `config/task.example.yaml`, `config/risk-types.yaml`, `config/result-schema.json`
- `prompts/masb-system.txt`

## Decisions Made

- Single-process CLI, SQLite, JSONL import/export, OpenAI-compatible facade.
- `response` is optional; `prompt` and `response` cannot both be empty.
- Unknown source fields are preserved.
- Structured result validation is local and strict.
- Account concurrency is configurable up to 500, with shared rate-limit cooldown.
- The first release must use the smallest readable implementation; all necessary Go comments are concise and written in Chinese.
- Final acceptance uses `deepseek-v4-pro` through the configured real gateway and must produce 50/50 valid output records.
- Configuration resolves all task-relative paths before execution and rejects YAML unknown fields and client-managed `extra_body` keys.

## Blockers / Risks

- Actual provider RPM/TPM and structured-output capability require task configuration.
- `modernc.org/sqlite v1.34.5` is declared for the next feature, but the configured module proxy left a cache lock and did not add its `go.sum` line. Resolve this before importing the driver.

## Next Session Startup

1. Read `AGENTS.md` completely.
2. Read the design specification.
3. Read `feature_list.json` and `progress.md`.
4. Run `./init.sh`.
5. Continue only from the documented recommended step.

## Recommended Next Step

- Resolve the SQLite module download lock if it persists, then implement `feat-002` JSONL import and SQLite state.
